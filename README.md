## Application Features

### Create New Listing

Users can access photos from their camera roll to list a new item for sale. Listed items are posted to the app's database and appear in the application's "Browse" view.

### Browse + Add to Cart

Users can browse all listings, view details for a single listing, and add items to their shopping cart. Adding an item to one's shopping cart toggles the item's availability and removes that item from the "Browse" view. When a user removes an item from their cart, the availability is toggled again and the item becomes visible in the "Browse" view.
